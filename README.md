# Call for Proposals - DWeb Camp - Peer to Peer Space

## Peer-to-Peer Space
Peer-to-Peer space is a track (sub-camp) organized within [DWeb camp](https://dwebcamp.org/) happening on August 24-28, 2022 in Camp Navarro, CA.

Peer to Peer space is not only about technology but also about person-to-person interaction intermediated by technologies. 

The P2P space is focused on the Person-to-Person relationships and networks of relationships. In this space, a peer isn't just a device, but another person who we share common ground with. We invite all sorts of proposals for this space, whether it's a technology that intermediates and fosters P2P connections, or an activity, or exercise that that creates a direct experience of Person to Person networks, please feel free to submit. We welcome all sorts of proposals, and are particularly excited about ones that have are experiential.

Experimental offerings are ones that engage people with one another. That could mean physical movement, talking to one another, interacting with each other through an app, a guided process, making things like crafts.
